Once you've caught up using those you'll have the base knowledge you'll need to get started on this repository!


## :rocket: Let's get started!

### Creating a repository & cloning app content

  1. First steps, let's create a repository on GitHub! Make sure to include a README.md, a License and a `.gitignore`
  2. Now, we're going to clone our repository from GitHub using the command: 
  
      ```console
      git clone <YOUR REPO SSH LINK HERE>
      ```

  3. Let's now pull the content from this repository into your local repository as a baseline to work off of!
  
      ```console
      git remote add git@github.com:FourthBrain/Branching-out-of-the-Notebook.git
      ```
